# iris-multi-layer-perceptron
Write a computer program that trains a series of perceptrons, based on PLA, to classify iris data  
* Features/Attributes:  Sepal length, Sepal width, Patel length, Patel width  
* Class labels/Species: Versicolor, Setosa, Virginica  
* The Iris dataset includes three iris species, Versicolor, Setosa and Virginica, with 50 samples each, where each sample is represented by four features, Petal_Length (in cm), Petal_Width (in cm), Sepal_Length (in cm) and Sepal_Width (in cm), for an Iris flower.
